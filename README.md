# Chatbot Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques**.  
The chatbot is designed to understand user intent and generate **context-aware responses in real time**, improving the overall user interaction experience.

The project demonstrates practical application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **sequence modeling** using deep learning.

## Objectives
- Understand and classify user intent from natural language input
- Generate accurate and meaningful responses
- Handle diverse user queries effectively
- Build a scalable chatbot pipeline using deep learning

## Approach & Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning and normalization
   - Tokenization and sequence padding
   - Vocabulary creation

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for sequence understanding
   - Embedding layers for semantic representation
   - Dense layers for intent classification

3. **Training**
   - Supervised learning on labeled conversational data
   - Optimized using appropriate loss functions and optimizers

4. **Inference**
   - User input is processed and passed through the trained model
   - Predicted intent is mapped to a relevant response
     
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **NLP:** Tokenization, Word Embeddings  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

## Key Features
- Context-aware response generation
- Handles multiple user intents
- Robust to varied user input
- Modular and extensible design

## Results
- Achieved high intent classification accuracy on training data
- Improved response relevance compared to rule-based chatbots
- Demonstrates effective use of Bi-LSTM for conversational AI

## Future Improvements
- Add transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)
- Improve contextual memory across conversations
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI
- Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech

## Conclusion
This project highlights the use of deep learning for building intelligent conversational systems.  
It showcases skills in **NLP, neural networks, and end-to-end ML project development**, making it suitable for machine learning and data science roles.
